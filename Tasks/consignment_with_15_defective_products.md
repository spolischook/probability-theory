# Consignment with 15 defective products

### The problem

Probability of defective part is 10%.  
What probability that 15 products will be defective from 200 products.

### Solution

The solution can be found by formula of local theorem of Moivre-Laplace

![Moivreâ€“Laplace local theorem](./formulas/moivre-laplace-local-theorem.svg)

So we could just put our values to the formula

p = 0.1  
q = 0.9  
k = 15  
n = 200
