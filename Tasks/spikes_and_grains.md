# Spikes and grains

### The problem

Next seeds was accumulated to sow:

- 1 grade 95%
- 2 grade 3%
- 3 grade 2%

The probability that 1 spike has 50 seeds is:

- 0,5 for the 1-st grade
- 0,2 for 2-nd grade
- 0,1 for 3-rd grade

What the probability that one random spike has 50 seeds?

### Solution

The solution can be found by [law (or formula) of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability):
